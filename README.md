## About Us

The **yiddict.app** project seeks to bring a convenient, easy-to-use dictionary app for all speakers and learners of _ייִדיש_.

The content on **yiddict.app** is sourced from _Raphael Finkel's_ own Yiddish-English dictionary lookup site. In fact, this website fetches its entry data directly from Finkel's in its current state. The motivation for **yiddict.app** stemms in large part from a personal desire to improve the user experience of Finkel's site and to update its interface to current tastes and use cases (i.e. mobile web browsers).

## Future Goals:

- Native apps for iOS and Android
- Offline functionality
- Search suggestions
- Proper English-Yiddish search and entries
- More data sources
